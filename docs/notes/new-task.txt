Yep. Hereâ€™s a **detailed, â€œdo this nextâ€ guide** for your **current setup** + how to use **Codex in your IDE** to drive the project.

Iâ€™m assuming youâ€™re on **Windows 11 + VS Code + Docker Desktop**, and your repo is repo root with `docker/compose.yaml`, plus services like HA, Mosquitto, Node-RED, Grafana, Ollama, and your Python agent writing to InfluxDB 3 Core (8181).

---

## 1) Lock down your current stack first (stability)

Right now youâ€™re on `quay.io/influxdb/influxdb3-core:latest` and logs show a nightly. Thatâ€™s unstable.

### 1.1 Pin InfluxDB 3 to a fixed tag

In `docker/compose.yaml`, change the image from:

* `quay.io/influxdb/influxdb3-core:latest`
  to a **specific version tag** (stable). Donâ€™t use `latest`. (This is a general best practice; your own summary already notes it.)

### 1.2 Stop running InfluxDB with `--without-auth`

Keeping DB unauthenticated is fine for a 10-min test. Not fine for a real lab.

* Remove `--without-auth`
* Add proper auth (token/user) and keep secrets in `.env`

(InfluxDB 3 Core is SQL-first and not the same as Influx 1/2, so donâ€™t follow random â€œ8086 bucketâ€ tutorials.)

---

## 2) What to do in Grafana (InfluxDB 3 is SQL-first)

Because youâ€™re on InfluxDB 3 Core, the Grafana datasource + queries will look different from Influx 1/2 guides.

### Recommended approach (clean and scalable)

* Keep letting your **agent** write curated tables like `mqtt_event`, `agent_suggestion` (you already have these).
* Grafana reads from InfluxDB for charts.
* Later, add Postgres for â€œbrain memoryâ€ (approvals, metadata, embeddings) if you want.

This keeps HA out of the DB-writing problem and avoids tutorial mismatch.

## 3) IDE setup: Codex in VS Code (the best path for you)

There are two â€œCodexâ€ tools you should use together:

1. **Codex VS Code Extension** (in-editor agent) ([OpenAI Developers][1])
2. **Codex CLI** (terminal agent inside your repo) ([OpenAI Developers][2])

### 3.1 Install the VS Code extension

Install **Codex â€“ OpenAIâ€™s coding agent** from the VS Code Marketplace (publisher OpenAI). ([Visual Studio Marketplace][3])

After install:

* Sign in / connect your plan (Plus/Pro/Business/Edu/Enterprise include Codex). ([OpenAI Developers][1])

### 3.2 Give Codex the *right workspace*

Open VS Code at the repo root:

* repo root (not a subfolder)

So it sees:

* `docker/compose.yaml`
* `.env`
* `services/agent/â€¦`
* any scripts, docs, etc.

### 3.3 Set up a â€œsafe workflowâ€ in Codex (important)

In VS Code Codex, use this rule:

* **Plan mode first** (ask it to propose steps)
* Then **apply changes**
* Then **run tests** (docker compose up, health checks, query checks)

Codex is designed to read/edit/run code, but you still want it working like a disciplined teammate. ([OpenAI Developers][4])

---

## 4) Install and use Codex CLI (this is huge for your stack)

Codex CLI is an agent that can operate inside a directory (read/change/run code). Itâ€™s open source and meant for terminal workflows. ([OpenAI Developers][2])

### 4.1 Install Codex CLI

Follow the official Codex CLI doc for install steps and auth. ([OpenAI Developers][2])

### 4.2 Use it correctly in this repo

Open terminal at:

* repo root

Then you can ask it to do things like:

* â€œPin InfluxDB image version and remove without-auth; update agent and grafana config accordingly.â€
* â€œAdd an `.env.example` and move secrets out of compose.â€
* â€œCreate a Grafana dashboard JSON for mqtt_event + agent_suggestion.â€
* â€œAdd make targets: up/down/logs/health.â€

Codex CLI is explicitly built to work locally in the selected directory. ([OpenAI Developers][2])

---

## 5) What language to use (for your â€œbrainâ€ code)

For your labâ€™s agent service:

* **Python** is the fastest path (FastAPI + paho-mqtt + Influx client/SQL calls)
* Keep it as a container (`services/agent`) so it migrates to any OS.

You already have `services/agent/app.py`, so donâ€™t rewriteâ€”extend.

---

## 6) The exact â€œCodex tasksâ€ you should run next (copy/paste)

Use these as prompts to Codex (VS Code or CLI):

1. **Stabilize Influx**

> â€œPin influxdb3-core image to a stable tag (not latest), remove --without-auth, add token-based auth using .env. Update agent and grafana to authenticate.â€

2. **Make a reproducible dev workflow**

> â€œAdd Makefile tasks: up, down, logs, ps, restart, healthcheck. Add README with exact commands and ports.â€

3. **Standardize schema**

> â€œCreate a schema doc for mqtt_event, agent_suggestion, and add agent_action_audit. Update agent to write consistent fields.â€

4. **Grafana dashboards**

> â€œCreate a Grafana dashboard JSON that shows: mqtt_event count by topic, last device state, suggestions timeline, and error rate.â€

---

## 7) One warning (so you donâ€™t get stuck)

InfluxDB 3 Core â‰  InfluxDB 2 tutorials.
So if you want â€œtutorial compatibilityâ€, youâ€™d revert to Influx 2.8.
But since youâ€™re building an intelligent lab, keeping v3 is fineâ€”just **treat your agent as the ingestion layer**.

---

## Quick check: what IDE are you using now?

If itâ€™s **VS Code**, tell me:

* Are you coding inside **Windows** or **WSL2**?

Then Iâ€™ll give you the cleanest â€œCodex + Docker + repoâ€ workflow (terminal commands, recommended settings, and a ready-to-use task list).
